## Introduction

Kuvha is an open-source web application tool to organize the interactions with your loved ones. Think of it as a [CRM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management) 


### Who is it for?

In today's digital age, it's easy to lose touch. This project is to help people stay attentive and stay on top of the people that matter in order to be a better friend, mentor, sibling, sales person, networker.

> Your professional and personal life usually have a pretty clear line drawn between them. Yet sometimes, the tools you use in your professional life, such as a day planner and address book, could benefit you personally or even vice-versa.

### What Kuvha isn't

 * Kuvha is not a social network and **never will be**. It's not meant to be social. In fact, it's for your eyes only.
 * Kuvha is not a smart assistant - it won't guess what you want to do.
 * Kuvha is not a tool that will scan your data and do nasty things with it.

## Open thank you to open source

Kuvha uses a lot of open source projects. The vision and generosity of the open source community has let us explore potential applications, ideas, algorithms and designs … for free! The hope is that by providing Kuvha as a free, open source project it will help other people the same way those free open source softwares have helped make this possible.
